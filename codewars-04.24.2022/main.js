// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

function smash (words) {
    return words.join(' ')
  };

  //You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

// Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

// For example, update_light('green') should return 'yellow'.

function updateLight(current) {
    if(current == 'green'){
      return 'yellow'
    }else if(current == 'yellow'){
      return 'red'
    }else if(current == 'red'){
      return 'green'
    }
